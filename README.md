dotfiles (3rd gen)
==================

So many wasted hours to get these just right... only a matter of time until the next version.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo

  ```
  git clone --recursive https://orther@github.com/orther/dotfiles.git
  ```

1. Install (links all config files and installs app w/ homebrew)

  ```
  make install
  ```

1. Start working those money makers (your fingers)!!!


## Prior Art

 - The Makefile and Brewfile are edited version of files I copied from here:
   https://github.com/peel/dotfiles
